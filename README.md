<h1>LARI - Laboratory Reconciliation and Information System</h1>
<h2>Managing the Future of AFSL</h2>
<p>The LARI program is going to replace the multitude of Excel sheets that allow the AFSL to continue to run and function properly.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>Making a great program comes with rules. Here are ours:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure all methods are fully documented. If you are not sure, look at comments from other files.</li>
    <li>Line lengths should not exceed 100 characters.</li>
    <li>Indentation width is 4 spaces. Don't use tabs to indent. You can change settings in your IDE to accomodate this.</li>
    <li>If there is extra work to be done in your portion of the code, or some followup comment, please preceed it with "TODO", e.g. <code>//TODO: Refactor this code</code> or <code>//TODO: Complete this method</code>.
    <li>Any method implemented on the backend should have a corresponding unit test.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have a user story corresponding to the work you have to do on Perforce. If not, tell the Lead Software Engineer of the lab.</li>
    <li>Do NOT commit the <code>LARI/LARI.csproj</code> file. If you do, I will personally revert your commit :)</li>
</ul>

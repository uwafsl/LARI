    <ol>
        <li>Download Visual Studio Community Edition (or other)</li>
            <p>We are developing everything in Visual Studio for this project. Visual Studio works great with C#, and the lab has most of its experience with Visual Studio rather than another text editor. If you prefer a different IDE, feel free to use it.
            <p>If you are in the CSE major, keep in mind you get access to <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/lab/software">Visual Studio Enterprise Edition</a> already. Otherwise, download the <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio Community Edition (Free)</a>.
        <li>Download the UWSDK from Perforce</li>
            <p>Obviously, this implies that you already have Perforce setup. If you do not have it setup, please contact Dr. Lum or the Flight Operations Director to get setup.
            <p>The UWSDK holds the backend of our project. If you are not familiar with the terms "frontend" or "backend", I found a <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/front-end-development-vs-back-end-development-where-to-start">blog post</a> that did a good job showing the differences. For CSE students, it's important to know the difference, especially at career fairs as recruiters will ask which you prefer (If you don't know, full-stack is always the safest option.)
